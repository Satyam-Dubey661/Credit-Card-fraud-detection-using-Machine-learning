# Credit-Card-fraud-detection-using-Machine-learning
End-to-end Credit Card Fraud Detection ML project with SMOTE handling and Streamlit deployment.
Project Overview

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset was highly imbalanced, and special techniques were applied to improve model performance.

Features

Data preprocessing and scaling

Class imbalance handling using
SMOTE

Trained models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Model evaluation using Precision, Recall and F1-score

Deployed interactive web app using
Streamlit

Deployment

The trained model was saved using Joblib and deployed as a Streamlit web application where users can input transaction features or upload CSV files to get fraud predictions.
